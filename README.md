# PythonRobotCVEXCortex
Example project for 2 way communication between a VEX Cortex (EDR) and Python.  The Cortex runs RobotC and is connected via UART to USB (USB to TTL serial RS232 Cable)

This is based on work by JMarple https://github.com/JMarple/BNSBluetooth who wrote the main library for RobotC, I have just made a sample program for Python and RobotC

This uses PySerial https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/
